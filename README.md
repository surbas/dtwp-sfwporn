dtwp-sfwporn
===================

## Desktop Wallpaper from reddit's SFW Porn Network ##

A python script that grabs the top scoring jpg image from subreddits like EarthPorn on the SFW Porn Network, and 
makes it the current desktop wallpaper.

It does this without needing any extra packages. Every effort will be made to keep it like this, put PIL support may be 
needed in the future for advanced image editing techniques.

Currently only tested on Win 7 with python 2.7, but should work with python 2.6. Other OS's will be supported soon.
